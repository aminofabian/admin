## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Creating a Company:
1. Click "Add Company" button in the top right
2. Fill in all required fields (marked with *)
3. Optionally fill in Game API configuration
4. Click "Create Company"
5. Success message appears, modal closes, list refreshes

### Editing a Company:
1. Click the edit icon (pencil) in the Actions column
2. Modify desired fields
3. Click "Update Company"
4. Success message appears, modal closes, list refreshes

### Activating/Deactivating a Company:
1. Click the status icon in the Actions column
2. Confirm the action in the dialog
3. Success message appears, status badge updates

### Searching Companies:
1. Type in the search box in the card header
2. Search queries: username, email, or project name
3. Results update automatically (debounced)

### Pagination:
1. Use Previous/Next buttons at bottom of table
2. Page numbers display current position

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Password is never displayed or pre-filled in edit mode
- All API calls include authentication token (JWT)
- Input validation prevents XSS attacks
- No sensitive data exposed in error messages
- Confirmation required before deactivating companies

## 📊 State Management

The page uses React hooks for state management:
- `useState` - Local component state
- `useEffect` - Data fetching and side effects
- `usePagination` - Custom hook for pagination logic
- `useSearch` - Custom hook with debouncing for search

## 🎯 Best Practices Followed

1. **TypeScript** - Fully typed for type safety
2. **Component Reusability** - Modal and Form are reusable
3. **Separation of Concerns** - API calls in separate files
4. **Error Handling** - Try-catch blocks with user-friendly messages
5. **Loading States** - User feedback during async operations
6. **Form Validation** - Client-side validation before API calls
7. **Clean Code** - Readable, maintainable, and well-structured
8. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach
9. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliant components

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Create a new company with all required fields
- [ ] Create a company with optional fields
- [ ] Edit an existing company
- [ ] Try to submit form with empty required fields
- [ ] Try to submit with invalid email format
- [ ] Try to submit with short username (< 4 chars)
- [ ] Try to submit with short password (< 5 chars)
- [ ] Search for companies by username
- [ ] Search for companies by email
- [ ] Navigate through pagination
- [ ] Deactivate an active company
- [ ] Activate an inactive company
- [ ] Close modal without saving
- [ ] Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### API Error Scenarios to Test:
- [ ] Duplicate username
- [ ] Duplicate email
- [ ] Network timeout
- [ ] Unauthorized access (expired token)
- [ ] Server error (500)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Delete Functionality** - By design, companies are deactivated rather than deleted to preserve data integrity (as per API specification)
2. **No Logo Upload** - Logo field exists in the type definition but UI not implemented (can be added if needed)
3. **No Single Company Detail View** - List and edit only (detail view could be added)
4. **Client-Side Validation Only** - Backend validation errors are displayed but format may vary

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- [ ] Logo upload with preview
- [ ] Bulk operations (activate/deactivate multiple)
- [ ] Export companies to CSV
- [ ] Advanced filters (by status, creation date)
- [ ] Company detail/dashboard page
- [ ] Audit log (who created/modified when)
- [ ] Company statistics (number of users, transactions, etc.)
- [ ] Multi-step form wizard for complex onboarding
- [ ] Duplicate company functionality
- [ ] Bulk import from CSV

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Modal doesn't open:

- Ensure Modal component is imported correctly

### Form validation not working:
- Check that all field names match the type definitions
- Ensure error state is properly managed

### API calls failing:
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set in `.env.local`
- Check that authentication token is valid
- Inspect network tab in browser DevTools

### Search not working:
- Ensure debounce is working (300ms delay)
- Check API endpoint supports search parameter

### Companies not loading:
- Check console for API errors
- Verify backend is running
- Check authentication token
